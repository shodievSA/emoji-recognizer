- <b>Emoji recognizer using brain.js neural network library.</b>

- After you clone the repository, you will need to open the "main.html" file via the "Live Server" extension.

- When you open the file in the browser you will see a white square. This is the canvas where you can draw emojis by pressing a mouse.
  
- Before the neural network can start recognizing emojis, you will need to feed it with some training data. Here is how you can do it:
  
    1. Draw the emoji (either smiley or sad).
    2. Press the V key on your keyboard.
    3. After you press the key, you will be prompted to tell if the emoji you drew is positive (smiley) or negative (sad).
    4. Clear the canvas by clicking the C key on your keyboard.

- After providing 3-5 samples for each emoji, you can start testing your neural network by drawing an emoji and pressing the B key on your keyboard.

- Since the training data is stored in the local storage, you will not need to train your neural network again after refreshing the page.
